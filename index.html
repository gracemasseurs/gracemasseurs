<h1>MY DRAWING APPLICATION</h1>
            
<p>My aim is to make a drawing application: a potentially shippable product</p>
<p>I made nine different sprints to reach my aim, below is the planning, testing and finished products as a result of these sprints</p>
<p>Click on the links to access my drawing application sprints</p>

<h1>RELEVANT IMPLICATIONS </h1>

<h5>Future Proofing </h5>
<p class = "end">  Program is designed so new features can be added easily and old ones removed
<br> Adressed   - in the way the program has been designed. Project elements(
    colours, buttons, shapes) have all been programmed as objects,  means each object is a self-contained, modular piece of code, 
    that takes a defined set of parameters to work,(may take basic mouse data and color), all objects are built to a similar 
    structure and compulsory contain an update function which means they can appear on the interface using the update call, 
    management of most of the objects happens in a central place (control object), the idea is that an experienced programmer 
    would easily be able to remove elements or add new features, comments are also precise and informative.  
 <p>

<p class = "end"> Functionality - does the program work well? Is it free of bugs? loads quickly? works on different browsers? 
        have we addressed this? Program is pure javascript, has no graphics, so loads very quicky, 
        I have tested by using a live web server to store my versions and have observed loading performance <br>
        - To ensure the program works well I have systematically tested it, tested user interactions
         (position of clicking and direction of dragging. This has included careful checks around boundaries. 
         The use of the Math.abs function was discovered after testing failures drawing circular shapes(because 
         these objects where being given negative radius values).<br>
         Any new components were tested prior to being added to the main program. At various stages in sprints, 
         console logging was used to analyze boundary test functions, and locate problems when bugs appeared.
    </p>

<h5>Examples of Trialing and Making Decisions</h5>
<p class ="end"> Can you find examples of exploring different options and making a decision about which is the best solution?
        <br> - Trying to figure out doing buttons for different line widths so that the user is able to choose what size the line will be. 
        <br> - Trying to created the guided shape(each shape has their own guided shape)
        <br> - what the best way was to do the colour buttons (which was by loops)

</p>

<p class = "end">Effectively using information from testing and trialing to 
    improve the functionaility of the outcome.
    <br> - Interface design trialing color themes 
    <br> - Different line width sizes 
    <br> - Changing the transparency of the colors - look too similar 
    <br> - figuring out sizing for the brush sizes(don't want them too similar)
    <br> - changing the colour scheme (which ones go together)
    
    </p>

<p class = "end">How did your working process(planning, testing, trialing)lead to the development of a 
    high-quality digital outcome? 
    <br> How was the Agile process helpful?
    <br> - Allowed planning and development to happen together
    <br> - Created repeated cycles of plan - develop - test.
    <br> - after two or three sprints I got a much clearer idea 
            of what I could achieve and my aims became much more focused and realistic

<!---- Sprint One starts below here -->  
<h1>SPRINT ONE</h1>

<p>When the user presses down on the mouse and drags, a rectangle appears and when the mouse is released, the rectangle will stay on the screen</p>
<p> My aim for the my first sprint is to create a simple drawing area on a canvas and be able to draw a rectangle inside of the drawing area. 
    This program should allow the user to drag a rectangle out within a boundary box (drawing area) by the mouse location and mouse start.
    When the rectangle has been created, it should be coloured in and remain on the screen.</p>

<h2>My Trello Plan </h2>
<div><img class="imageSize" src="Trello/SPRINTONE.png"></div>

<p>This is the planning I did before I began coding for my boundary rectangle. 
    Where normally the shape would disaapear after the mouse leaves the boundary rectangle, 
    by putting inplace the mMove(e) {} as seen in my notes ensured that the user could 
    still draw a shape after the mouse leaves the boundary. </p>
<div><img class="imageSize" src="Planning/S1Planning.JPG"></div>

<p> This first test uses console logging to test if my boundary function is working properly </p>
<p> and determines whether the mouse is inside the boundary rectangle or outside </p>

    <source src="Videos/S1Test1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    </div>

<p> This second test shows that the user is able to drag a rectangle inside the boundary and a rectangle appears at different co-ordinates </p>
<p> It also shows how a user cannot drag a rectangle when the xMouseStart and yMouseStart are outside of the boundary rectangle </p>

<div class="videoDiv"><video width="600"  controls>
    <source src="Videos/S1Test2.mp4" type="video/mp4">

    </div>

<p> This third test shows how the rectangle cannot be drawn outside of the rectangle boundary however, when the mouse is outside of the boundary the shape can still be drawn and clings to the edges. </p>

<h1>SPRINT TWO</h1>

<p>The aim of my second sprint is for the user to be able to draw an ellipse inside the boundary instead of a rectangle</p>

<h2>My Trello Plan </h2>
<div><img class="imageSize" src="Trello/SPRINTTWO.png"></div>

<p> This test shows that an ellipse can be drawn on the canvas. The test shows that the ellipse cannot be drawn from outside of the boundary to inside however can be drawn from inside of the boundary out.</p>

<!---- Sprint Three starts below here -->  
<h1>SPRINT THREE</h1>

<p>My aim for Sprint Three is to have two buttons where the user can switch 
   between a rectangle and an ellipse being dragged across the boundary rectangle. 
   Therefore, I am making a new file for the button. </p>

<!---- Sprint Four starts below here -->  
<h1>SPRINT FOUR</h1>

<p> My aim for Sprint Four is to allow the user the choice of what colour the chosen shape is. 
    My aim is to include multiple different colours (rainbow) with different tones of each.
    For example, light pink, a mix between pink and red, red. </p>

<!---- Sprint Five starts below here -->  
<h1>SPRINT FIVE</h1>

<p>The aim of this sprint is for the user to have more choice with the drawings they create. 
   This can be achieved by adding in another shape option - circle. Also, by adding reset and undo buttons, 
   I aim to make the usability of this program simpler. </p>

<h2>Reset and Undo Trello Plan </h2>

<p>This test shows that the circle can be drawn with different colours and the rectangle boundary is 
   still working with a different shape put it. This video shows how the circle button is working in 
   conjunction with the other two buttons and now the user can switch between three shapes.</p>

<!---- Sprint Six starts below here -->  
<h1>SPRINT SIX</h1>

<p>My aim for my sixth sprint is to give the user more options - in this case, 
   to be able to draw a line on the canvas. Eventually I hope to have the line not 
   have a set width however, I will do that in future sprints.</p>

<!---- Sprint Eight starts below here -->  
<h1>SPRINT EIGHT</h1>

<p>My aim for sprint eight is to allow more options for my user in terms of colour. 
   By keeping the same colours as I already have however, adding transparencies the 
   user can layer shapes over one another. I will also add a square shape, thus making 
   the program look more put together as all the spaces have been filled and there is more choice for the user. </p>
